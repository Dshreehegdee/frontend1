## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I learned how to effectively use Flexbox for layout and how to optimize images for web use. Hereâ€™s an example of a CSS rule I found particularly useful:

```css
.card {
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
### Acknowledgments
A special thanks to the Frontend Mentor community for their support and inspiration throughout this project.
